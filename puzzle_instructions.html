  <h2>
    Instructions: First Puzzle-Solving Task
  </h2>

  <p>
    For the first task of this study you will solve a puzzle. You and your partner will work on solving the same puzzle independently.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can earn real money by completing this task. If you correctly solve the puzzle, you will receive an extra $1.00 bonus payment. Similarly, if your partner correctly solves the puzzle, your partner will receive an extra $1.00 bonus payment. If you both correctly solve the puzzle, both of you will receive $1.00 bonus payments. In other words, your own earnings are in no way affected by your partner's earnings.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the first puzzle task, <b>one of you will be randomly selected to receive a hint</b> that will make solving the puzzle easier. The other participant will be asked to complete the puzzle without receiving a hint. The participant that is to receive the hint will be randomly selected by the system.
  </p>

    Press "Next" when you're done reading the instructions and are ready to start the Puzzle-Solving Task.
