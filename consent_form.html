  <!--
  Everyone has their own coding conventions but these are my two cents. CCS should be used to create all formatting. You can create separate classes if you think some paragraphs should be formatted differently than others. There should be very little formatting *within* a body of content. For instance, all of the details below are formatted under the same header pattern (I'm using h4 to distinguish it from h2 above). Just use that formatting once and separate content with line breaks. Also, try to make the source code as readable as possible. If there's an ambiguous part, you can annotate the source code with a comment (like this one) without it affecting the overall aesthetics of the working document (see 'Explanation of Procedures' section for an example).

    Title of Research Study: <b>Human Judgment and Decision Making</b>
    <br />
    IRB Protocol Number: <b>18-0511</b>
    <br />
    Principle Investigator: <b>Eric Pedersen</b>
    <br />

    <i>Purpose of Study</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
    We invite you to take part in a research study because you are 18 years of age or older and are part of either the SONA General Psychology subject pool or the SONA Paid subject pool at the University of Colorado Boulder.
    <br />
    <br />
    The purpose of the study is to understand how individual differences in certain psychological traits affects human decision making and performance across a number of tasks.
    <br />
    <br />
    We expect that you will be in this research study for less than 60 minutes. We expect about 3000 people will be in this research study.
  </p>
  <h4>
    <i>Explanation of Procedures</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
    This study has two main components. The first component entails a series of judgment and decision-making tasks. This will include individual tasks in which you will be presented with puzzles and games to solve on your own, as well as joint
    tasks, in which you will participate alongside a partner. In some of these tasks, there will be the potential for you to earn
    <!-- Highlighting in yellow is fine to show that something needs to be fixed, but this won't translate to someone who is just editing the source code. Instead, put in a comment like this one to point out where information needs to be corrected. Notice how it doesn't affect how the output looks. Importantly, make sure this comment says something descriptive, such as:
    Need to add information on bonus payments. -->
    <span style="background: yellow;">a bonus cash payment for yourself or for others. A bonus cash payment is not XXX...</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    The second component entails a set of survey questionnaires. These questionnaires are designed to measure individual and demographic differences between people, and will allow us to see how these relate to performance in the judgment and
    decision-making tasks. All of the data collected in this study will come from these measures.
    <br />
    <br />
    This research will take place in Muenzinger Hall, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Colorado Boulder. This research will be conducted between September 1, 2018, and May 30, 2020. Your participation will last 60
    minutes or less.
  </p>
  <h4>
    <i>Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Whether or not you take part in this research is your choice. You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. If you decide to withdraw for the study, any data collected during your session will be erased and will not be used for analyses.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you are a CU Boulder student or employee, taking part in this research is not part of your class work or duties. You can refuse to enroll, or withdraw after enrolling at any time, with no effect on your class standing, grades, or job at CU Boulder. You will not be offered or receive any special consideration if you take part in this research.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you are a CU student enrolled in General Psychology, instead of being in this research study, your options may include writing a short paper instead (consult your General Psychology syllabus for details).

  <h4>
    <i>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
    There are no physical risks to the study, and we do not expect there will be any psychological risks.
  </p>
  <h4>
    <i>What else do I need to know?</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Students at the University of Colorado Boulder participating in this research as part of the SONA Credit Subject Pool will receive 1 credit toward General Psychology research credits for participating.
    <br />
    <br />
    Individuals who participate in this research as part of the SONA Paid Subject Pool will be paid either <span style="background: yellow;">$6 or $12</span> depending on the length of the study, based on a rate of $12/hour for their participation.</span>

  <h4>
    <i>Potential Benefits</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
    We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, possible benefits include bonus payment as a result of your participation on some of the study's tasks. The bonus payment you might receive will depend on your choices during some of the study's procedures. These choices might also result in bonus payments for other participants in this study. Importantly, these bonus payments are NOT compensation for participating in the study. As described <span style="background: red;">above</span>, all participants will receive <span style="background: red;">course credit</span> as compensation for participation in this study. Thus, participants who receive bonus payments based on the results of certain study tasks will receive such payment in addition to the <span style="background: red;">course credit.</span>
  </p>
  <h4>
    <i>Confidentiality</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Information obtained about you for this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research information that identifies you may be shared with the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board (IRB) and others who
    are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to research, including people on behalf of the Office for Human Research Protections. The information from this research may be published for scientific purposes; however,
    your identity will not be given out.

    <!-- What's happening with this formatting? -->
